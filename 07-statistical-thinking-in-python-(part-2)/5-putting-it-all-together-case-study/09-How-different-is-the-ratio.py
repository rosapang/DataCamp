How different is the ratio?
In the last exercise, you showed that the mean beak length to depth ratio was 1.58 in 1975 and 1.47 in 2012. The low end of the 1975 99% confidence interval was 1.56 mm and the high end of the 99% confidence interval in 2012 was 1.49 mm. In addition to these results, what would you say about the ratio of beak length to depth?

Possible Answers
The mean beak length-to-depth ratio decreased by about 0.1, or 7%, from 1975 to 2012. The 99% confidence intervals are not even close to overlapping, so this is a real change. The beak shape changed.

It is impossible to say if this is a real effect or just due to noise without computing a p-value. Let me compute the p-value and get back to you.
