'''How many no-hitters in a season?
In baseball, a no-hitter is a game in which a pitcher does not allow the other team to get a hit. This is a rare event, and since the beginning of the so-called modern era of baseball (starting in 1901), there have only been 251 of them through the 2015 season in over 200,000 games. The ECDF of the number of no-hitters in a season is shown to the right. Which probability distribution would be appropriate to describe the number of no-hitters we would expect in a given season?

Note: The no-hitter data set was scraped and calculated from the data sets available at retrosheet.org (license).
